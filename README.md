# About
This program is meant to dump and view infos from those Pokèmon that are deposited into the Pokémon HOME application. 
**This program is not intended to edit/inject Pokémon Infos directly into HOME and it will never allow to. Do not ask for any injection features.**

Powered by [PKHeX.Core](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) and [SysBot.Base](https://github.com/kwsch/SysBot.NET)

## Features:
* Handle (dump, load, view) PKH/PH1/EH1/PH2/EH2 (Pokémon Home format) files.
* Generate PB7/PK8/PB8/PA8/PK9 (Pokémon Game-Specific format) files from Pokémon Home data/files.

## Use Cases example:
* Dump & preserve all your Pokémon Home PKM files, and/or load the files in PKHeX
* Get access to all the Pokémon that are stuck beyond the first Pokémon Home Box if the Pokémon Home subscription is no longer active.
* Generate a cloned Pokémon to be used on any of the Core game series while preserving the original data into your Pokémon Home account (this will preserve unique Go, Home, or Bank stamps).

## Notes
The creators of this tool are not responsible for any adverse outcomes or side effects of using this tool.

We do not condone use of cheating and modified data to take advantage of others. Trading converted files without disclosure could be considered scam.

# Disclosure about the Dumper feature:

The Plugin creates a 1:1 dump for the encrypted Pokémon HOME data. If requested by the user, PKHeX can decrypt the dumped files. Please be aware that the Pokémon HOME data structure might change in the future.

# Disclosure about the Viewer feature:

PKHeX simulates a conversion from the Pokémon HOME data format to a standard PKM file based on the current game mode loaded.

This process is unofficial and there is always the chance that it does not accurately replicate an official transfer.

If you proceed with this tool, you accept the following:

* The PKM files from the conversion can not be considered legitimate, even if the original encounter was. The files will be legal at best.

* Do NOT use the obtained files to report legality issues with PKHeX. Join the [Manu's Discord](https://discord.gg/yWveAjKbKt) server for support.
