# About

This Plugin is meant to allow people to dump and view infos from those Pokémons that are stuck in HOME beyond the first Box, or that for some reason the owner does not want to transfer away (eg. Unique GO/HOME Symbol sticker or SWSH unavailable mons). This Plugin is not intended to allow users to edit Pokémon Infos directly from HOME and it will never allow to.

# Prerequisites

- Hacked Switch with [Atmosphère](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) installed.

- [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase/releases) sysmodule running on the system.

- Online Internet connection.

- HOME Subscription is not needed.

# How to use 

Download the DLL from [Project Pokémon](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4388-pkhex-plugin-home-live-viewer/).

For Windows users, right click on the DLL, go to properties and select "Unlock".

Move the DLL to your PKHeX/Plugins folder, if you don't have it, just create it.

Open PKHeX with a Sword/Shield Save File, or a Blank SWSH save, and click on Tools->HOME to open the Plugin.

Open the Pokémon HOME application from your Nintendo Switch and tap the screen and least once. 

Enter your IP Adrress, select the Boxes you want to show and click "Connect".

For any problems or suggestion, feel free to write an issue on the GitHub or on the [Project Pokémon thread](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/58311-pkhex-home-live-plugin-ram-viewer-thread/).
