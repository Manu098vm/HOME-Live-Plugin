# About

This Plugin is meant to allow people to dump and view infos from those Pokémons that are stuck in HOME beyond the first Box, or that for some reason the owner does not want to transfer away (eg. Unique GO/HOME Symbol sticker or game-specific unavailable mons). This Plugin is not intended to allow users to edit Pokémon Infos directly from HOME and it will never allow to.

This Plugin is not developed by the PKHeX Development Projects server, so do NOT report problems or request support there. Use the [Project Pokémon thread](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/58311-pkhex-home-live-plugin-ram-viewer-thread/) instead.

The creators of this tool are not responsible for any adverse outcomes or side effects of using this tool.

We do not condone use of cheating and modified data to take advantage of others. Trading converted files without disclosure could be considered scam.

# Disclosure about the Dumper feature:

The Plugin creates a 1:1 dump for the encrypted Pokémon HOME data, in the EH1 format. If requested by the user, PKHeX can decrypt that dump in the PH1 format. Please be aware that these format structure might change in the future.

# Disclosure about the Viewer feature:

PKHeX simulates a conversion from the Pokémon HOME data format (PH1) to standard PKM file formats based on the current loaded save file.

This process is unofficial and there is always the chance that it does not accurately replicate an official transfer.

If you proceed with this tool, you accept the following:

* The PKM files from the conversion are NOT legitimate in any way, even if the original encounter was.

* The resulting files from the conversion may not even be legal in some circumstances.

* When using 'Convert any PKM data if compatible with save file', it is likely that the resulting Pokémon will be illegal.

* Do NOT use converted PKM in online battles/trades.

* Do NOT use converted files to report legality issues, whether in the Project Pokémon forums/Discord or in the PKHeX Development Projects Discord.

* The Viewer is intended for research, learning, and entertainment purposes.
